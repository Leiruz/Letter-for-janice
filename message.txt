Dear Janice,

I hope this letter finds you in a place of peace, and I hope that by the time you read this, even if the pain is still there, it isn’t as sharp as it once was. I know I have no right to ask for anything from you—not your time, not your forgiveness, not even a second thought. But if there’s one thing I need to do before we go our separate ways, it’s to tell you how truly sorry I am.

I made a terrible mistake—one that I regret more than words can ever express. Flirting with Angeline, sending those messages, betraying your trust… I still can’t believe I was capable of hurting the one person who meant the world to me. There’s no excuse for what I did. No justification. I was weak, selfish, and reckless with your heart. And for that, I will
always carry this regret with me.

But Janice, please believe me when I say that what we had was real to me. Every single moment we spent together is etched into my soul. The way you looked at me when you woke up, your sleepy, confused face that made me smile every morning. The way we laughed at your old TikTok videos, as if the world outside didn’t exist. The way you trusted me enough to let me tie your hair, how I’d secretly admire how beautiful you looked—especially with your long hair, so don’t cut it, okay?

I cherish the simple things too - walking with you across campus, carrying your heavy bag, doing laundry together, holding onto whatever small excuses I could find just to be close to you. Those little moments were everything to me. And I’m terrified that one day, they’ll fade from your memory, while I will remember them forever.

This relationship taught me so much. You taught me so much. You showed me love, patience, and kindness, even when I didn’t deserve it. You forgave me over and over again, giving me chance after chance, and still, I let you down. I was blind to how lucky I was to have you, and now I have to live with the reality that I lost the best thing that ever happened to me.

Janice, if there’s one thing, I need you to know, it’s that you are enough. You are more than enough. You are kind, intelligent, and beautiful in ways you don’t even realise. I wish you could see yourself through my eyes. I wish you could believe in yourself the way I believe in you. Please, never let anyone—not me, not anyone—make you doubt your worth.

I know I don’t deserve your forgiveness. And I don’t expect it. But I hope that one day, when time has softened the pain, you’ll look back and remember not just how it ended, but how much I truly, deeply loved you.

I’m sorry I couldn’t keep my promises. I’m sorry our dreams of growing old together, laughing at our white hairs, will never come true. But I still hope, with all my heart, that you find someone who will love you the way you deserve. Someone who will never make the mistakes I made. Someone who will cherish you the way I should have.

Please take care of yourself. Drink lots of water, eat proper meals, drink less coffee and don’t let stress get the better of you. Sleep early, even when life gets overwhelming. And please, always think things through before making impulsive decisions—you know how you are.

Keep playing tennis, because one day, I know you’ll be amazing at it. I don’t know what the future holds for us, but I hope that when we see each other in school, we won’t be strangers. I hope we’ll still be able to smile and say hi.

I love you so much, and I’m so, so sorry.

Goodbye, Janice.
