#My Dearest Janice,

As I write this letter, I want you to know that it comes from the deepest corners of my heart. This is not just a simple Valentine’s gesture; it’s something that I want you to hold on to whenever we face hard times. There may be moments when we feel lost, when our differences seem too much to bear, and the weight of our struggles feels heavier than the love we share. But through all of that, I want you to remember one thing: it is in these differences that our love grows stronger.

Fate may have brought us together through a shared class in university, but it is us—our unique hearts, our flaws, and our strengths—that bind us. I know that love isn’t always easy, and being in a relationship, especially one as meaningful as ours, can be the hardest journey. But it’s a journey I am grateful for every single day. I cherish your patience, your kindness, and the unwavering love you’ve given me since the very beginning.

You’ve seen the imperfect parts of me—the ones I wish I could change—and yet, you’ve loved me with all your heart, mind, and soul. I am endlessly thankful for that.

So, when you read this, I hope it reminds you of all the beautiful moments we’ve shared—the laughter, the tears, the growth. I hope it serves as a reminder of the love that has carried us this far, and the love that will continue to guide us through whatever comes next.

You mean everything to me, Janice. I love you with all that I am, and I always will.

Yours,
Zuriel
